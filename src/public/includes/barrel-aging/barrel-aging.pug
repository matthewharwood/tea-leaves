        p Just as the French oak barrel imparts richness and nuance to the wine inside it, the same wine imparts its
          | character on the barrel itself. The barrel used to produce the 2010 Rudd Oakville Estate Red offers complex
          | mineral, fruit, wood and vanilla notes, which plays in perfect harmony with the imperial scented jasmine white
          | tea. The tea was aged 200+ days in the French oak barrel at TEALEAVESâ€™ Vancouver Blending Center, ensuring
          | that the oak and wine aromas were absorbed into the white tea at the right levels.  TEALEAVES Master Blenders
          | conducted weekly tastings, modifying the absorption through ambient temperature and relative humidity &ndash
          | to blend this tea with optimal balance and nuance.
