        p Just as the French oak barrel imparts richness and nuance to the wine inside it, the same wine imparts its character on the barrel itself. The barrel used to produce the 2010 Rudd Oakville Estate Red offers complex mineral, fruit, wood and vanilla notes, which plays in perfect harmony with the imperial scented jasmine white tea. The tea was aged 200+ days in the French oak barrel at TEALEAVESâ€™ Vancouver Blending Center, ensuring that the oak and wine aromas were absorbed into the white tea at the right levels.  TEALEAVES Master Blenders conducted weekly tastings, modifying the absorption through ambient temperature and relative humidity &ndash; to blend this tea with optimal balance and nuance.
