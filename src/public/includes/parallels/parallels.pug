              | Resulting in an intriguing soft slightly vegetal cup, the tea leaves are hand-picked from only the top-most leaves and buds of the camellia sinensis (tea) plant and hand-dried using a heated tray over fire. It takes hundreds of hours to make the small batch that fills the wine barrel used to make the TEALEAVES x Rudd Blend.

              | Taste a perfect harmony of Jasmine and toast from the TEALEAVES x Rudd Blend. Labor intensive, the leaves were scented and re-scented 7 times in Fuzhou, China with the leaves placed between bamboo sheets of jasmine to absorb the aromas. The technique pays homage to the traditional Chinese method of imperial-scenting.

              | Subtle notes of oak and vanilla are the result of a careful aging in toasted oak barrels. Rudd Oakville Estate uses handcrafted, French oak barrels sourced from 400-year-old forests in France.
